# Regression-project-of-factors-affecting-financial-flexibility-using-R-programming-language
This project analyzes the financial flexibility of 648 non-financial listed companies in Vietnam’s stock market using R programming. By applying panel data regression with the Fixed Effect Model (FEM), key metrics such as Cash Flexibility (CF), Debt Flexibility (DF), and Altman’s Z-score were calculated. The analysis evaluates the impact of macroeconomic factors (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, and firm size) on financial flexibility during three periods: pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID.

Key Highlights:

Dataset: Financial data from 648 audited company reports (2015–2023).
Tools & Techniques: R Studio for statistical analysis, data cleaning and visualization.
Key Metrics: Financial flexibility indicators, macroeconomic variables and regression results.
Outcome: Insights into financial strategies to enhance flexibility and mitigate economic risks.
